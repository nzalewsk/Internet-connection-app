Plans for Development
1. Create 2 apps using C# in Visual Studio
2. From what I have learned, it might be easiest to create the gui first (First thing that showed up when I created the project after deciding where it would go
3. Have one client, one server
4. Have the client and server connect using TCP
5. Have the client and server send data? using UDP (connectionless protocol?)
6. Add functionality to decide between the two connections

Notes
1. I don't have Visual Studio on my computer, I am using Visual Studio 2015 through a remote desktop connection because I can't download it onto my computer
